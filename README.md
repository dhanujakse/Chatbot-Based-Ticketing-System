Development Tools: Python, TensorFlow, and Dialogflow for chatbot creation.
Deployment: Hosted on cloud platforms like AWS or Google Cloud for robust performance.
Integration: Connected to a mock ticketing system and tested with sample visitor interactions.
Results: Demonstrated efficient handling of ticket bookings, reduced response time, and seamless user experience.
